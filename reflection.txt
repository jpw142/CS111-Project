For my two sources I chose my wr120 paper and the script of everything everywhere all at once. For my four to compare to I chose Shakespear's All Right, Star Wars Episode 4, The Bible, and the wikipedia page on trains.

My results were that the script from Everything Everywhere all at once was most likely to come from the writers of Star Wars Episode 4 and second most likely to come from Shakespear. My Wr120 paper was by far most likely to come from wikipedia. I think that heuristically these both make sense and I am very proud of my results. I think it could be extremely improved with more heuristics, more complicated and in depth modeling with complex linguistics, and more texts to compare to. However, for a short project I am suprisingly proud of what I've accomplished
